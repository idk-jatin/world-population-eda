# Global Population Analysis (1970-2023):
I explored global population trends across countries and continents using historical population data from 1970 to 2023.
I majorly focused on getting the growth pattern and identifying countries with strong future population growth, rather than comparing absolute population sizes.

## Outcomes:
- Global population data is highly skewed and dominated by small number of countries
- Relative population growth provides a good insight for future expansion
- Africa has more countries with promising future expansion despite of lower current population size
- Population density alone is not a strong indicator for future growth pattern

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
